# Python 3.13 Compatibility Matrix

User-facing support matrix for minipy compared with Python 3.13 syntax and
behavior.

## When to Read

Read this when you need a quick answer about whether a Python feature is
implemented, restricted, parse-only, or out of scope in minipy.

For normative details, follow the owning spec document instead of treating this
matrix as the complete language specification.

## Source of Truth

| Concern | Source |
|---|---|
| lexical behavior | `docs/spec/01-lexical.md` |
| type behavior | `docs/spec/02-types.md` |
| accepted syntax | `docs/spec/03-grammar.md` |
| checker restrictions | `docs/spec/04-static-semantics.md` |
| lowering/runtime behavior | `docs/spec/05-codegen.md` |
| builtins/native modules | `docs/spec/06-builtins.md` |
| planned/deferred work | `docs/roadmap.md` |

## Legend

This matrix compares minipy with Python 3.13 syntax and behavior. It describes
what the current compiler accepts, checks, and lowers; it is not a roadmap for
full CPython compatibility.

- ✅ implemented and lowered
- ◐ partially implemented or implemented with stricter static limits
- ⏳ parsed or planned, but rejected before lowering
- ❌ intentionally out of scope

## Source and Lexical Layer
