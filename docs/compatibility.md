# Python 3.13 Compatibility Matrix

User-facing support matrix for minipy compared with Python 3.13 syntax and
behavior.

## When to Read

Read this when you need a quick answer about whether a Python feature is
implemented, restricted, parse-only, or out of scope in minipy.

For normative details, follow the owning spec document instead of treating this
matrix as the complete language specification.

## Source of Truth

| Concern | Source |
|---|---|
| lexical behavior | `docs/spec/01-lexical.md` |
| type behavior | `docs/spec/02-types.md` |
| accepted syntax | `docs/spec/03-grammar.md` |
| checker restrictions | `docs/spec/04-static-semantics.md` |
| lowering/runtime behavior | `docs/spec/05-codegen.md` |
| builtins/native modules | `docs/spec/06-builtins.md` |
| planned/deferred work | `docs/roadmap.md` |

## Legend

This matrix compares minipy with Python 3.13 syntax and behavior. It describes
what the current compiler accepts, checks, and lowers; it is not a roadmap for
full CPython compatibility.

- ✅ implemented and lowered
- ◐ partially implemented or implemented with stricter static limits
- ⏳ parsed or planned, but rejected before lowering
- ❌ intentionally out of scope

## Source and Lexical Layer

| Unannotated assignment | ✅ | First assignment infers binding type. |
| Tuple/starred unpack assignment | ✅ | Supports list/tuple sources and homogeneous starred rest. |
| Chained assignment | ◐ | Parsed only into the current assignment representation; avoid relying on CPython multi-target semantics. |
| Augmented assignment | ◐ | Names and attributes supported; other targets rejected. |
| `del` | ✅ | Names, list/dict items, and attributes; captured names rejected. |
| `assert` | ✅ | Throws structured assertion error on false test. |

| `break`/`continue` | ✅ | Checked for loop scope. |
| `return` | ✅ | Checked for function scope and result type. |
| `yield` statement | ✅ | Supported in generator functions returning `Iterator[T]`. |

| `import` | ✅ | Module top-level only. |
| `from ... import ...` | ✅ | Module top-level only; aliases supported. |
| `from __future__ import ...` | ◐ | Module-prefix only; accepts `annotations`; string annotations also resolve without it. |
| `from ... import *` | ◐ | Static expansion only; uses static `__all__` or public names. |
| `try`/`except`/`else`/`finally` | ✅ | Structured VM error path. |
| `except*` | ⏳ | Parsed; ExceptionGroup semantics not implemented. |

| `async for`/`async with` | ⏳ | Parsed, rejected. |
| `match`/`case` | ✅ | Structural patterns with static checks. |

## Definitions

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Function definitions | ✅ | Optional annotations, default values, closures. |
| Positional-only params `/` | ✅ | Checked at call sites. |
| Keyword-only params `*` | ✅ | Checked at call sites. |
| `*args` parameter | ✅ | Collected as `list[T]`. |
| `**kwargs` parameter | ✅ | Collected as `dict[str, T]`. |
| Function decorators | ◐ | `@decorator`, `@module.decorator`, `@factory(...)`, `@module.factory(...)`, and stacking are supported when the decorator evaluates to exactly `Callable[[F], F]` for the decorated function's own signature `F`. Evaluated top to bottom, applied bottom to top, at definition time. Other decorator expression shapes (subscripts, boolean expressions, instance attributes) are rejected by the checker. |
| Return type inference | ✅ | Joins value-return branches. |
| Nested functions and closures | ✅ | Captures boxed when needed. |
| Generator functions | ✅ | `Iterator[T]` result required. |
| Class definitions | ✅ | Fixed field/method layout. |
| Single inheritance | ✅ | One supported base class. |
| Multiple inheritance | ⏳ | Parsed, rejected. |
| Class keywords/metaclass syntax | ⏳ | Parsed, rejected: `metaclass=` and other class keywords are rejected (tracked by #22); `**kwargs` class keywords are rejected as dynamic. |
| `@dataclass` | ✅ | `@dataclass` and `@dataclass()` behave identically; field constructor/default checks. |
| `@dataclass(...)` with options | ⏳ | Parsed, rejected (tracked by #32). |
| Other class decorators | ⏳ | Rejected (tracked by #22). |
| Methods and `self` | ✅ | `self` required; `__init__` returns `None`. |
| Special methods (`__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`) | ◐ | Static dispatch only; `len(obj)`, `obj[i]`, `obj[i] = v`. No other dunders, slicing, or `__iter__`. |

| `in` / `not in` | ✅ | Supported containers/strings/iterators. |
| Conditional expressions | ✅ | Arms must have same type. |
| Named expressions `:=` | ✅ | Name target only. |
| Lambdas | ◐ | Need expected `Callable` context. |

| Indexing | ✅ | Lists, dicts, strings, constant tuple indexes. |
| Slicing | ✅ | Lists and strings. |
| Slice assignment/deletion | ◐ | `list[T]` contiguous slices only; omitted step or literal `1`; replacement length must match. |

| List methods | ◐ | `append`, `pop`, `index`, `insert`, `extend`, and `reverse`; statically typed homogeneous lists only. |
| Dict literals | ✅ | Homogeneous; empty needs hint; scalar hashable keys. |
| Set literals | ✅ | Homogeneous; empty needs hint; scalar hashable elements. |
| Tuple literals | ✅ | Fixed arity, heterogeneous. |
| Starred list/set elements | ◐ | Statically typed sources only. |
| Dict unpacking in displays | ◐ | Dict sources only; dynamic call unpack still unsupported. |

| `typing.Optional[T]` and `typing.Union[...]` | ✅ | Normalize to closed union forms. |
